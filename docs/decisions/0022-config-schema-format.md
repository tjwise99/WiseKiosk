# 0022 — The configuration schema is one authored JSON Schema 2020-12 document, enforced by one in-page validator

**Status:** accepted
**Decided:** 2026-08-30 (per-module fragments and their composer dropped; the format itself taken
2026-08-15 in #8 config schema format)
**Rev:** 2

## Revisions

- **rev 2** — 2026-08-30 — the schema is a single hand-authored document with a section per module;
  per-module fragment files, the composer and the recomposition drift gate are dropped (owner,
  2026-08-30). The 2020-12 format, the one bundled in-page validator and the generated
  configuration types are unchanged. This changes what was chosen, so the `Decided` date moves with
  it (#156 config-schema composer).
- **rev 1** — 2026-08-15 — first written (#8 config schema format).

## Context

The configuration schema is the operator-facing artifact that states what a deployment may be
parameterised with (SYS003<!-- A deployment is parameterised from outside the image -->). Two
earlier decisions bound its neighbours but not its language: [ADR 0007 rev 2](0007-config-validation-allocation.md)
settled *where* validation runs — one TypeScript engine in the page, the backend config-blind — and
[ADR 0008 rev 3](0008-boundary-contract-openapi-codegen.md) settled the *boundary* contract as a
separate OpenAPI schema that never carries configuration. Neither names the format the configuration
schema is written in. That format is stated nowhere in the tree; this ADR decides it.

The demand is for a tooling ecosystem, not for an elegant type. The schema has more than one reader:

- **One enforcer, in the page.** [ADR 0007 rev 2](0007-config-validation-allocation.md) forbids a
  second validator, and validation runs at apply time — page load — not per render. The
  per-render-cost argument that ruled a runtime validator off the boundary in
  [ADR 0008 rev 3](0008-boundary-contract-openapi-codegen.md) does not reach a validator that runs
  once a load.
- **Machine-enumerable.** SRS024<!-- Every offered configuration key is exercised at a non-default value -->
  ranges *over the schema* to enumerate every offered key — "the schema is the finite
  machine-readable statement of what is offered" — so the format must be introspectable as data, not
  only executable as a check.
- **Organised per module, in one document.** [The module contract](../contracts/module-contract.md)
  states what a module's configuration declares; those declarations are sections of the one schema
  the page validates, authored in place rather than assembled from files. The format must therefore
  let one document carry a named, independently readable section per module.
- **Read by tools that are not the page.** The configuration generator (#70 configuration generator)
  and any future config editor read the schema as data to produce or drive a form over a valid
  configuration.

SYS005<!-- Single-definition internal contract --> does not bind here: it scopes itself out of the
configuration explicitly — the configuration format is shared with the operator and governed by
SYS003<!-- A deployment is parameterised from outside the image --> — so the internal
define-once-and-generate rule is not imposed on this artifact.
[ADR 0008 rev 3](0008-boundary-contract-openapi-codegen.md) already names the direction — JSON
Schema 2020-12 is the dialect the configuration schema and the boundary schema would share once
OpenAPI reaches 3.1.

(The ticket's older framing — a boot gate and a standalone desk validator — is stale:
[ADR 0007 rev 2](0007-config-validation-allocation.md) dropped both, and the surviving obligation is
the one-in-page-enforcer this ADR builds on.)

## Decision

- **The configuration schema is written in JSON Schema, draft 2020-12** — a data document, not
  TypeScript code and not emitted from a code-level schema builder. This is the ecosystem the readers
  above need: a standard the generator, a future editor, the docsite renderer, and validators in any
  language can consume without executing the project's own code.
- **One authored schema, with a section per module.** The configuration schema is a single JSON
  Schema document under `frontend/src/config/` ([ADR 0021 rev 2](0021-repository-layout.md)),
  hand-authored and hand-edited. Each module's keys are a named section within it; there is no
  per-module file, nothing recomposes, and no gate regenerates the schema and compares it — there
  is no generated form of it to compare against. This is the same single-authored-file rule
  [ADR 0008 rev 3](0008-boundary-contract-openapi-codegen.md) keeps for the boundary, where a
  module's payload is a named component *inside* the one OpenAPI schema rather than a file beside
  the module; the configuration schema reads the same way, and a module's configuration is
  added by editing one file. The authored unit is the schema.
- **Exactly one validator enforces it, bundled and in the page**, 2020-12-capable, run at apply
  time. This ADR fixes the *format*, not the library: the concrete validator — a 2020-12 runtime
  such as ajv's 2020 build or `@cfworker/json-schema`, or a build-time standalone-compiled
  validation function to hold the bundle down on a Pi-Zero-class browser
  ([ADR 0018 rev 1](0018-frontend-svelte-vite-static-spa.md)) — is chosen when the frontend skeleton
  (#10) is built, against a bundle that does not exist yet. Whatever is chosen, there is one of it
  ([ADR 0007 rev 2](0007-config-validation-allocation.md)).
- **The configuration-object TypeScript types are generated from the schema**, drift-gated, so the
  schema is the one source of the configuration's shape and that shape lives as data rather than as
  code.

A module's section is an ordinary 2020-12 subschema — a good configuration validates, a malformed
one is rejected:

```json
{
  "title": "clock module configuration",
  "type": "object",
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "required": ["region"],
  "properties": {
    "region": { "type": "string", "enum": ["top-left", "top-right", "centre"] },
    "twentyFourHour": { "type": "boolean", "default": true }
  }
}
```

`{ "region": "centre", "twentyFourHour": false }` validates; `{ "region": "middle" }` is rejected —
`region` is not one of the allowed values, and `additionalProperties: false` rejects an unknown key
the same way. Where a section sits within the one document, and under what key, is the first
module's to settle (#12 first module end-to-end): the shape above is what a section *is*, not where
it goes. This is the acceptance property demonstrated, not a wired product test: that test
enumerates the schema's keys and lands with the frontend skeleton
(TST016<!-- Pending: every schema key is varied by a fixture and renders -->, #10), and the
malformed-input obligation is already recorded against
SRS002<!-- A module-scoped configuration error is reported at that module -->.

## Alternatives considered

- **A TypeScript-native schema library (Zod, Valibot).** The schema is authored as TypeScript and
  yields runtime validation and static types from one source, with no generation step — genuinely
  elegant, and Valibot is small enough for the bundle. Rejected because the schema would be *code*:
  the generator and a future editor would have to execute the project's TypeScript to read it, the
  key enumeration SRS024<!-- Every offered configuration key is exercised at a non-default value -->
  needs would rest on a library's internal introspection rather than on a portable document, and the
  docsite would render from a lossy code-to-JSON-Schema conversion. It also diverges from the
  2020-12 dialect [ADR 0008 rev 3](0008-boundary-contract-openapi-codegen.md) is heading toward. The
  ticket asks for the tooling ecosystem over the elegant type, and this is the type over the
  ecosystem.
- **TypeBox.** Authored in TypeScript, emitting a real JSON Schema document *and* static types *and*
  a validator from one source — the data document without the generation step Zod lacks. Rejected
  because it makes the schema generated rather than authored, which is the same cost
  [ADR 0008 rev 3](0008-boundary-contract-openapi-codegen.md) used to reject TypeSpec for the
  boundary: an authoring layer whose only consumer is a handful of small schemas, generality ahead
  of a second use.
- **Folding the configuration into the boundary (OpenAPI) schema.** Foreclosed upstream: the
  configuration never crosses the boundary ([ADR 0007 rev 2](0007-config-validation-allocation.md)),
  and [ADR 0008 rev 3](0008-boundary-contract-openapi-codegen.md) keeps it a separate artifact. A
  shared *dialect* when OpenAPI reaches 3.1 is a shared vocabulary, not a merged schema.

## Consequences

- One data document with a broad ecosystem: the generator (#70 configuration generator), a
  future editor, and the docsite all read it as data, and the key enumeration
  SRS024<!-- Every offered configuration key is exercised at a non-default value --> asks for is a
  walk over a standard document rather than over a library's internals.
- It converges with the boundary schema on JSON Schema 2020-12 — the shared *vocabulary*
  [ADR 0008 rev 3](0008-boundary-contract-openapi-codegen.md) names, and a candidate for a shared
  docsite render — while staying a separate schema that never crosses the wire.
- A validator ships in the bundle. Weight is owned under
  [ADR 0018 rev 1](0018-frontend-svelte-vite-static-spa.md) and is addressable by compiling the
  schema to a standalone validation function at build, so the full runtime need not ship; the
  library choice is deferred to #10 rather than pinned here against a build that does not exist.
- Generating the configuration-object TypeScript types from the schema adds a drift gate, the same
  generated-not-hand-written pattern the boundary contract carries — one more pinned generator to
  keep current.
- JSON Schema is authored data, not a new authored language: it is a format a tool consumes, which
  [ADR 0017 rev 8](0017-authored-language-set.md) counts as invoking rather than authoring, so the
  authored-language set is unchanged.
- The `additionalProperties: false` discipline the sample shows is what lets an unknown key be a
  rejection an operator sees, rather than a silently ignored typo — the schema is the finite
  statement of what is offered, and everything outside it is refused.
