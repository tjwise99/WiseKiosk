# 0008 — Boundary contract: one OpenAPI schema, the whole wire contract generated from it

**Status:** accepted
**Decided:** 2026-08-31 (rev 4's input shape and seam location, both taken at the first module data
route on #220 weather module; the types-to-wire-contract pivot taken 2026-08-23 in the #188 boundary
codegen session, and the surrounding model 2026-07-23 at the boundary-contract requirements round
#37, with the codegen-mechanism trade carried by #7 boundary-contract codegen). This ADR records the
mechanism **decision**; the **build** is #7 boundary-contract codegen, and rev 3's migration is
#188 boundary codegen.
**Rev:** 4

## Revisions

- **rev 4** — 2026-08-31 — rev 3's open question is answered by the first module data route, and
  answered in two parts. A module data route carries its inputs as a **generated JSON request body**
  rather than as request parameters, which is the only shape that binds nothing outside the standard
  library while leaving both sides' field names generated — so the two generators read one document,
  with nothing standing between the schema and either of them. And the generated `ServerInterface`
  method is **the module's own**, provided from the module's package rather than written in the
  registry, so the shared tree carries one line per module and no module logic. `router.Entry` loses
  `Validate` and `BuildURL` to the module's handler, which is what makes the generated request type a
  thing the code reads rather than a thing it merely emits. Runtime self-registration joins
  *Alternatives considered*, moved out of the module contract, whose index row bars a rejected
  alternative (#220 weather module).
- **rev 3** — 2026-08-23 — both sides generate the **whole wire contract** — routes, client, server
  and types — where rev 2 generated types alone and left every route hand-authored on each side. That
  gap put the route outside what the drift gate compares, and a hand-rolled per-route drift script was
  written to patch it. `openapi-typescript` gives way to `orval`; the Go side turns on
  `oapi-codegen`'s `std-http-server` and `client` targets. `/healthz` enters the schema, and the
  schema is recorded as holding two kinds of path (#188 boundary codegen).
- **rev 2** — 2026-08-12 — the schema's location, left open here and named as another ticket's to
  take, is [ADR 0021 rev 1](0021-repository-layout.md)'s; the sentences deferring it now cite that
  record. The mechanism, the version and the drift gate are unchanged (#5 repo layout).
- **rev 1** — 2026-08-05 — revision tracking begins; text as merged (#118 ADR revisions).

## Context

The Go backend and the TypeScript frontend share no types ([ADR 0001 rev 1](0001-backend-language-go.md)),
which makes the boundary contract non-negotiable: **one schema, both sides generated from it**, CI
failing on stale generated code. Round #37 elicited the requirements for that property
(SYS005<!-- Single-definition internal contract -->;
SRS015<!-- One schema, all boundary value classes -->–SRS016<!-- Both sides consume the generated types -->)
deliberately **mechanism-agnostic** — a "shall" that names a tool churns when the tool changes. This
ADR chooses the tool, which is the decision half of #7.

#7 was gated on the repository layout — where the single schema and the two packages live. Choosing
the mechanism does not need that layout; only *building* it does, so this ADR took the decision
without one, and [ADR 0021 rev 2](0021-repository-layout.md) supplied the layout afterwards. #7's
acceptance — schema file present, both generators wired, drift gate green — is what waited.

**What rev 3 reopens.** Rev 2 read "both sides generated from it" as *both sides' types*, and the
first route to exist showed what that leaves out. The path was hand-authored on each side — a Go
constant and a TypeScript string — and neither was compared to anything: what the drift gate
regenerated were types, and the Go generator's output did not carry a path at all. The gap was then
patched by a bespoke script written to compare the two hand-authored strings, a second enforcer for
the property the drift gate already exists to hold. That is the shape of a mechanism decided one
notch too narrow, so rev 3 widens it to the whole wire contract rather than adding the script.

## Decision

- **One hand-authored OpenAPI schema is the single definition**, owned by neither package (it sits at
  `boundary/openapi.yaml`, per [ADR 0021 rev 2](0021-repository-layout.md)). A module contributes its payload as a **named component inside
  that schema**: the *fragment* [the module contract](../contracts/module-contract.md) part 6 names is
  that component, a section of the one schema rather than a file of its own, so nothing recomposes and
  the schema stays authored rather than generated. Rejected — one fragment file per module, recomposed
  into the committed schema: it buys per-module file ownership at the cost of a composition stage in
  the drift gate and an OpenAPI that is generated output, which is the same cost that rules out
  TypeSpec below. The configuration schema's shape is #8's and nothing here settles it.
- **OpenAPI 3.0.3 now; 3.1 is the stated migration target.** 3.1's schema objects *are* JSON Schema
  2020-12, which would give one dialect shared with the configuration schema (open question 4) and a
  common docsite render — but `oapi-codegen` has historically lagged 3.1. Start on the interop-safe
  version; migrate once both generators handle 3.1 cleanly, whatever renders the schema does, and
  the config-schema format is settled.
- **Each side generates its whole wire contract — routes, client, server and types — not types
  alone.** Types-only generation leaves every route hand-authored twice, which puts the one thing the
  single-definition rule is about *outside* what the drift gate compares. A generated *type* naming a
  path is not enough: the request is issued and served by hand-written strings, so the gate can agree
  with itself while the two sides disagree with each other. Rev 2 had it that way, and the first
  liveness route promptly grew a bespoke per-route drift script to patch the hole by hand. Generating
  the route table closes it by construction — the registration and the call site are both output of
  the schema, so a path that moves is a difference the existing gate sees.
- **Go via `oapi-codegen`** with `models`, `std-http-server` and `client`. `std-http-server` binds
  against the standard library's own `net/http.ServeMux` through a structural interface `*http.ServeMux`
  already satisfies, so **no router dependency and no new module requirement** — the process keeps
  its own `main` and its own multiplexer, and the generated half is one file. The one part of the
  emitted Go that would need a module is parameter binding, which is why rev 4 puts a module data
  route's inputs where no binding is generated at all.
- **TypeScript via `orval`** (its `fetch` client), which replaces `openapi-typescript`. It emits one
  self-contained file whose every declaration is local — nothing resolves into `node_modules`, which
  is what SRS016<!-- Both sides consume the generated types --> requires of a boundary value's
  declaration — and whose client is a bare `fetch` call, so **nothing enters the browser module
  graph and the bundle carries no runtime helper** (the Raspberry-Pi-Zero-class constraint decides
  this, as it did when the same clause bought types-only emission). It declares no `typescript` peer,
  so the generator cannot hold a TypeScript upgrade hostage. Its output is formatted by `prettier`,
  orval's own declared peer, because the raw emission carries stray semicolons and blank-line runs.
- **The schema holds two kinds of path.** A **module data route** carries the full component set —
  its success payload, the upstream-failure body and the client-rejection body — and is what
  [the module contract](../contracts/module-contract.md) governs. An **infrastructure route** answers
  about the process rather than about a source, declares its own response and nothing else, and is
  not a module's to contribute. Rev 3 brings one in, `/healthz`, whose 200 carries no body at all
  because every consumer reads the status code; which paths of either kind exist is the schema's to
  say, and is not counted here. The distinction is recorded because the schema's
  conventions were written module-shaped, and **both** of
  TST032<!-- Pending: boundary schema is single and complete -->'s path-level clauses are scoped to
  module data routes when it is activated. Its "every path declares the error set" assertion is,
  because that is where the obligation comes from — an infrastructure route has no upstream to fail
  and no request to reject. Its "schema path items equal the static route registration list, in both
  directions" assertion is too, for the same reason one clause over: that list holds one entry per
  upstream-backed module, so `/healthz` is a path item that has no entry in it and is never going to
  acquire one. Read unscoped, the clause is false the moment an infrastructure route exists, and the
  reading that repairs it — adding registry plumbing for a liveness route — would invent a module
  where there is none.
- **A module data route's generated method is the module's own, provided from the module's own
  package.** Writing it in the registry, beside the entry it reaches, would put a module's
  name and a module's import inside shared framework code — which [the module
  contract](../contracts/module-contract.md)'s dependency direction and its build step 7 both
  forbid, and which no reading of part 5's *entry* licenses. What the module owns lives where the
  module is: the module's package holds its registration entry, the route built
  from it, and a zero-value type carrying the method the generated `ServerInterface` declares for
  its path. The shared registration list is then a struct with **one embedded field per module** and
  nothing else — no import beyond the module's own package, no method body, no policy, no name
  appearing twice.

  The compile-time tie is unchanged in kind and stronger in placement: the composite of the
  infrastructure routes' handler and that list is asserted against the generated interface at the
  assembly point, so a route the schema declares and no module has taken up is a missing method on a
  named type rather than a path answered from somewhere else. Nothing registers at runtime and
  nothing registers itself.

  **The composite is hand-written, and it cannot be otherwise.** Generating it into the generated
  package would make that package import a module's package, and a module imports it for the
  payload type — an import cycle, not a matter of taste. `oapi-codegen` emits into one package and
  overrides built-in templates only, so it cannot emit a second file or a second package at all.
  Rejected — a generator of our own to synthesise the composite: against a population of about five
  routes one line per module is the cheaper of the two. Rejected — keeping the method in the
  registry, which is what the contract refuses.
- **A module data route carries its inputs as a JSON request body, declared as a named component
  in the schema.** The driver is
  [ADR 0001 rev 1](0001-backend-language-go.md)'s near-zero dependency stance, which this decision
  treats as **load-bearing rather than a preference**: the backend is to run natively on
  Pi-Zero-class hardware — a separately scoped concern this record does not design for — and what
  that asks of the boundary is only that nothing here adds a runtime dependency, under any option.

  What decides the dependency is not configuration but **how a parameter is declared**. In the
  pinned generator a parameter carrying a `schema:` is *styled*, and styled binds through
  `github.com/oapi-codegen/runtime` on the server **and independently again in the client**, which
  is not droppable — the liveness probe uses it
  ([ADR 0020 rev 2](0020-release-artifact-set-and-operator-tooling.md)). No `output-options` flag
  changes that. A request body does not go through that path at all: the non-strict handler is
  handed the request untouched, the body type is generated from the schema on both sides, and the
  decoding is `encoding/json`. Measured on the whole contract: zero imports of that module, zero
  references to it, the emitted package compiling against an unchanged `go.mod`.

  Three properties follow. There is
  **one validator** of a request's inputs — the module's — where a generated binding would refuse
  some requests before the module ever saw them. **No response can leave this backend outside the
  shapes this schema declares**, because the generated wrapper has nothing to fail on and never
  reaches its `ErrorHandlerFunc`. And the request's field **names are generated on both sides**,
  rather than spelled on the Go side in a pair of hand-written constants — a second definition site
  SRS015<!-- One schema, all boundary value classes --> does not admit and
  SRS016<!-- Both sides consume the generated types --> forbids in as many words.

  **Nothing stands between the schema and either generator**: no second document, no strictness
  ritual such a document would need, and no jsonpath dialect the generator already calls deprecated
  and would eventually refuse. The claim rev 3 made — one schema, both sides generated from it —
  holds without a footnote.

  The verb is a consequence rather than a choice: a body is what carries generated field names, and
  `GET` is not the method to carry one under. What is given up is the idiom of a read being a `GET`,
  which costs this system nothing it has — nothing between the display and the backend caches, and
  the response cache is in the process. What is gained beyond the above is a cache key over
  **decoded values** rather than over a query string, so two spellings of one location stop being
  two cache entries and two rate budgets.
- **The schema defines every value class that crosses the boundary**
  (SRS015<!-- One schema, all boundary value classes -->): the names and types of everything a
  request carries, success payloads, the structured body for the upstream failure
  SRS001<!-- A failed module shows why, and only that module --> obliges a module to render, the
  client-error rejection body SRS013<!-- Client-facing contract for rejected requests --> requires
  the frontend to be able to render, and every response status code the frontend discriminates on.
  SRS001<!-- A failed module shows why, and only that module --> and
  SRS013<!-- Client-facing contract for rejected requests --> oblige the behaviour; the shapes that
  carry it are defined here and nowhere else, because
  SRS015<!-- One schema, all boundary value classes --> admits no second definition site.
- **Drift gate:** a repo-level CI check regenerates both sides and fails on any difference
  (`git diff --exit-status`); the generators are **version-pinned** so a toolchain bump cannot read
  as schema drift (SRS016<!-- Both sides consume the generated types -->; verified by
  TST033<!-- Pending: boundary codegen drift-gate test -->). The gate is repo-level because it
  spans both packages. It also **compiles** each side's output, because a generator exits zero on any
  configuration it accepts — including one naming fewer targets than the code consumes — and a
  non-empty assertion passes on a file missing a whole target. Compilation is what makes the consumer
  the judge of what was generated.
- **The frontend consumes the generated contract only — no runtime re-validation of proxied payloads.**
  The version-skew case a runtime validator defends against is foreclosed by single-image co-deploy,
  and a bundled validator (schema→zod/ajv) would cost weight and per-render CPU on the Pi against a
  case that does not exist. **Reopen if the two sides ever become independently deployable** — that
  is the premise the foreclosure rests on, and nothing else here survives its loss. This was once a
  requirement; it was deleted as a prohibition against a case that does not exist, and this ADR is
  its home.
- **Docsite: withdrawn as a decision here.** Rev 2 named `sphinxcontrib-openapi` as the renderer, on
  the generated-not-authored, single-toolchain pattern of doorstop→needs and likec4→mermaid
  ([ADR 0004 rev 1](0004-docs-site-sphinx-needs.md)). How the schema is *presented* is a separate
  trade from how it is *generated*, and rev 3 leaves it to #195 API explorer (split from #188
  boundary codegen), which takes the renderer choice with the interactive option on the table rather
  than inheriting a static one settled in passing here. Nothing renders the schema until it lands.

## Alternatives considered

- **OpenAPI 3.1 as the starting point** — rejected *for now* on tool maturity (`oapi-codegen` lags
  3.1); adopted as the migration target rather than dropped.
- **`openapi-typescript` (TypeScript)** — the incumbent through rev 2, and correct while the decision
  was types-only: it emits declarations and erases at compile. It emits *only* declarations, so it
  cannot carry rev 3's route table or client, and it holds a `typescript@^5.x` peer that pins the
  repository's own TypeScript version. Superseded rather than found wanting on its own terms.
- **TypeSpec → OpenAPI** — a more ergonomic authoring DSL, but it adds a Node compile hop and a
  second generation stage in the drift gate, and makes the OpenAPI itself a generated artifact. An
  authoring abstraction whose only consumer is ~5 routes — generality ahead of a second use
  ([`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)'s review checklist, generality).
- **JSON Schema only** (json-schema-to-typescript / quicktype) — models payload bodies but not
  operations, parameters, or status codes, so the request-parameter and rejection-status contract
  would live in a second definition: the exact silent-divergence defect the single-schema rule
  kills.
- **protobuf / gRPC** — a transport change disguised as a codegen choice. Browsers cannot speak gRPC
  without a gRPC-web proxy, and it replaces the REST-over-JSON proxy the design commits to — a
  transport chosen against the access pattern, which polls and needs no live channel (the pull-based
  shape [the module contract](../contracts/module-contract.md) is built against).
- **Smithy** — can emit OpenAPI, but carries a JVM toolchain and trait/projection machinery far
  beyond a five-route proxy.
- **`ogen` (Go)** — best-in-class 3.1 with generated request/response validation; kept as the
  documented fallback if 3.1 plus server-side validation are later wanted, but heavier (its own
  router, a large generated surface) than a thin proxy needs today. Rev 3's move to server
  generation does not cross that line: `oapi-codegen`'s `std-http-server` binds against the standard
  library's own `net/http.ServeMux`, where the objection to `ogen` was a router of its own. The
  concern was never *generating a server*; it was owning the routing layer.
- **`openapi-generator`, as the single tool covering both languages** — rejected. It is the only
  candidate spanning Go and TypeScript, and one tool would be simpler than two, but its `go-server`
  **mandates a third-party router**: a closed `mux`|`chi` option with no standard-library choice, and
  the router type is in the exported `NewRouter` signature rather than an internal detail — so the
  routing layer this design keeps ([ADR 0001 rev 1](0001-backend-language-go.md), and the `ogen`
  entry above) would be given away by the codegen choice. Beyond the kernel objection it requires a
  JVM and a downloaded jar on every machine and in CI, which nothing else in this repo needs, and it
  emits a whole-application scaffold — the Go spread across many files, plus a `main.go` and a
  Dockerfile that assume they own the process. The magnitudes behind that are the trial's, recorded
  on #188 boundary codegen. **This is why the decision is two native generators rather than one tool**: the
  cost of a second generator is two pinned versions, and the cost of the unified tool is a dependency
  the architecture refuses.
- **Frontend runtime validation (schema→zod/ajv)** — rejected: bundle weight and per-render cost on
  a Pi-Zero browser against a version-skew case foreclosed by single-image co-deploy.
- **A module data route keeping `GET` and its query parameters, accepting
  `github.com/oapi-codegen/runtime`** — rejected on the zero-dependency constraint, which this
  revision treats as hard. It is the shape with the least to explain and it costs three modules in
  `go.mod`, a dependency-vulnerability surface, and the property ADR 0001 rev 1 bought deliberately.
- **Declaring the query parameters in the schema's `content:` form**, which the generator binds with
  the standard library — rejected, and rejected on measurement rather than taste: `orval` refuses
  the document outright (*"Query parameter \"lat\" has no schema or content definition"*), so the
  frontend cannot be generated at all. A shape only one of two generators accepts is not a shape
  this design can take.
- **An overlay rewriting the parameters into that form for the Go side alone** — rejected, and it is
  the closest runner-up: it is zero-dependency, keeps `GET`, and leaves the frontend untouched. It
  fails on what it does to the record. It puts a second document between the schema and one
  generator, so the two generators would read the same parameter at different types; the generated
  wrapper would reject a missing input before the module's validator, giving the route a second
  validator and putting a plain-text error on a path this schema declares; and it would rest on a
  jsonpath dialect the generator already calls deprecated. It buys idiom and pays in the properties
  this ADR exists to hold.
- **Path parameters** (`/api/weather/{lat}/{lon}`) — rejected. The pinned generator binds an
  ordinary path parameter through the runtime module as well; `r.PathValue` appears only as that
  call's argument. The `content:`-form variant is zero-dependency but loses the frontend's types
  (`orval` emits `lat: unknown`) and makes the Go handler's inputs **positional**, so a schema that
  reorders two segments silently swaps their meaning in code that still compiles.
- **User templates overriding the binding** — rejected. It would mean vendoring copies of two
  upstream templates pinned to this generator's version, and the drift gate regenerates *through*
  them, so an upstream change to either is a difference no gate can see.
- **A module registering itself as the process starts**, rather than a static compile-time list —
  rejected. It buys back the dependency direction the list gives up, a list the compiler checks
  being a list that names every module; it pays with the check. A route this schema declares and no
  module serves would become a fault found by running rather than by building, which is the whole of
  what binding the generated `ServerInterface` at compile time is for. The crossing the list costs is
  bounded to two files instead ([the module contract](../contracts/module-contract.md)
  § Dependency direction).

## Consequences

- **#7 becomes an implementation ticket**: the mechanism is settled; its build (schema file, wired
  generators, green drift gate) has the layout it waited for
  ([ADR 0021 rev 2](0021-repository-layout.md)).
- **Two pinned generators to keep current** — inherent to Go not sharing types (ADR 0001 rev 1 paid for
  this knowingly), tracked like any pinned tool. Rev 3 adds a third pin, `prettier`, which formats
  orval's output: unpinned it would reformat the committed contract on its own schedule and read as
  schema drift.
- **A route cannot be added by hand on either side.** Adding one means editing the schema and
  regenerating; a registration or a call written directly is either overwritten or reported as drift.
  That is the point, and it is also the cost — the schema sits on the critical path of every route
  change, not only of every payload change.
- **The schema's server interface is composed at the assembly point.** Rev 3's open question is
  answered above; what it correctly predicted is that `health.Route` stops satisfying the widened
  interface the moment a module data route exists. The generated interface is one and its two kinds
  of path are owned by different packages, so neither owner can implement the whole of it: the
  process's `main` composes the infrastructure routes' handler and the module registration list into
  the one value the generated router takes, and each module data route's method arrives on that value
  from the module's own package. A package's own tests reach the generated router the same way, by
  standing in for the routes that are not theirs — which is what keeps another package's path out of
  their assertions.
- **The backend's runtime dependency set stays empty, and the input shape is what keeps it that way.**
  `backend/go.mod` and `backend/go.sum` carry nothing the emitted code imports. A module data route
  declaring request parameters would add `github.com/oapi-codegen/runtime` plus
  `github.com/apapsch/go-jsonmerge/v2` and `github.com/google/uuid` beneath it, against
  [ADR 0001 rev 1](0001-backend-language-go.md)'s near-zero third-party dependencies and into the
  dependency-vulnerability gate ([`../CI.md`](../CI.md)). **Reopen if the zero-dependency constraint
  is ever lifted** — the whole of this shape is argued from it, and a `GET` with query parameters is
  what it would revert to. **Reopen too if `oapi-codegen` comes to bind a simple query parameter with
  the standard library alone**, which removes the reason without removing the constraint.
- **The Go client's view of a module data route carries its request body.** The `client` target emits
  the operation taking the generated request type, marshalled with `encoding/json`. Nothing calls it
  — the Go client exists for the liveness probe
  ([ADR 0020 rev 2](0020-release-artifact-set-and-operator-tooling.md)) — and it is generated rather
  than trimmed because trimming it is what would cost the probe its generated path.
- **The generated Go surface is larger than the types were.** `std-http-server` emits a parameter-error
  set and a middleware hook whether or not any route has parameters. Accepted: it is one file, it
  compiles, and it adds no dependency.
- **`orval` is small at the boundary and large in `node_modules`.** It ships undivided: installing it
  brings the whole set of `@orval/*` client generators although the configuration reaches only the
  `fetch` one, a documentation toolchain (`typedoc` and its plugins), and `esbuild` with a native
  binary package per platform — none of which the generator it replaces brought. **None of it reaches
  what ships**: the emitted client imports nothing, so the browser module graph and
  [`frontend/bundle-allowlist.json`](../../frontend/bundle-allowlist.json) are untouched, and the
  cost is build-time and supply-chain only. It is recorded because a Dependabot pull request against
  a package like `@orval/angular` is otherwise unexplainable to whoever has to weigh it: such packages
  are present because orval is one package, not because anything uses them. The size of that tree at
  any moment is `frontend/package-lock.json`'s to state, and is not counted here.
- **A generated route is method-scoped, where a hand-written one was not.** `std-http-server`
  registers `GET /healthz`, so the schema's `get:` is now load-bearing in a way it was not when the
  registration was `mux.Handle("/healthz", …)` and answered any verb. What an unlisted method gets is
  the served tree's answer rather than a 405, because the `/` seam matches the path when the
  method-scoped pattern does not — the observable is
  [`../ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md)'s. The general shape is that a generated pattern is more
  specific than the seams it sits beside, which is also the third strand of the open question above.
- **Hand-authored OpenAPI YAML is verbose** — accepted for ~5 payloads; the 3.1 migration and, if it
  ever bites, an authoring layer remain open.
- **The configuration schema stays a separate artifact**, TS-owned (ADR 0007 rev 2), never crossing the
  wire. When 3.1 lands, both schemas can share the JSON Schema 2020-12 dialect and whatever renders
  them — a shared *vocabulary*, not a merged schema (that would be abstraction without a second
  consumer).
- **Nothing renders the schema for a reader until #195 API explorer lands.** Rev 3 withdrew the
  renderer choice rather than replacing it, so the schema is readable as YAML and in no other form
  meanwhile.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md's "boundary contract" section** (its "open question 2") is answered by this ADR;
  the fuller prose is written when the mechanism is built, under #7 boundary-contract codegen.
- **The framework's request seam moves into the module, and that is the price of the generated
  type being read.** `router.Entry` loses `Validate` and `BuildURL`, which took `url.Values`: the
  generated request type is one type per operation and no shared struct field can name it, so
  keeping them would mean rebuilding `url.Values` from the generated struct — spelling the field
  names by hand again, which is the defect being fixed. The module's handler decodes, checks and
  names the cache key; the entry keeps the policies and the shaping. **A generated type nothing
  reads is not single-definition, it is emission.**
- **A module data route is a `POST` for a read, and the `Allow` header of the `/api/` seam says so.**
  The generated pattern is method-scoped, so what an unlisted method gets is that seam's answer.
  Nothing between the display and this backend caches, so the idiom is the whole of what is spent.
- **The `module-route` tag is not load-bearing.** Neither generator's path reads it; regenerating
  with the tag removed produces byte-identical output from both. It stays as
  the mark of which kind of path this is and as what
  TST032<!-- Pending: boundary schema is single and complete --> will select on, and a route that
  omits it builds cleanly — so nothing may be written anywhere claiming that omitting it breaks
  the build.
- **A module costs the shared tree one line** — one embedded field, with everything else a module
  needs held in the module's own package.
  **Reopen if the module population ever grows enough that one line each is a burden** — that is the
  premise under which generating the composite, rejected above, would be worth its own
  generator.
- **Requirement text stays mechanism-agnostic**
  (SYS005<!-- Single-definition internal contract -->,
  SRS015<!-- One schema, all boundary value classes -->–SRS016<!-- Both sides consume the generated types -->):
  this ADR is provenance, not cited inside the "shall" statements, so a later mechanism change
  touches the ADR and the generate step, not the tree.
