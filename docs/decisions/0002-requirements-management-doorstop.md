# 0002 — Requirements tracking and V&V with Doorstop

**Status:** accepted; Test-method linkage mechanism superseded by [0005](0005-traceability-gating.md)
**Decided:** 2026-07-21 (requirements-system spike, issue #14)

## Context

WiseKiosk is design-first, but its requirements live only as prose scattered across its design
documents — load-bearing invariants, standing test obligations, and an "each row becomes a testable
requirement… verified by" table. None of it has stable IDs, and nothing enforces that a
requirement actually traces to an artifact that verifies it. That proto-traceability is exactly the
kind of invariant this project prefers to mechanise rather than trust to vigilance: a "verified by"
column with nothing checking it decays silently. The project also has an explicit learning goal, and
internal engineering rigor is a stated driver — so a real requirements-and-V&V methodology is wanted,
not just a register.

## Decision

Adopt **Doorstop** — a Python, Git-native requirements tool — as the requirements and verification
store. Requirements live as per-item YAML under [`../requirements/`](../requirements/README.md) in a
three-document V-model tree: `SYS` (needs) → `SRS` (shall statements) → `TST` (verification items
whose `references` point at the real verifying files). Validation is wired into the same gate
developers and CI already run: a strict `just check-reqs` (`doorstop --error-all`) that fails on any
suspect, unreviewed, orphaned, or unresolved-reference item, mirrored exactly by the `requirements`
job in [`../../.github/workflows/checks.yml`](../../.github/workflows/checks.yml). The pin lives in
[`../requirements/requirements-dev.txt`](../requirements/requirements-dev.txt) — siloed with the
requirements it serves, not at the repo root; it is dev tooling only, no application Python ships.

## Alternatives considered

- **StrictDoc** — richer (custom grammar, requirement types, reqIF export, HTML/PDF publishing).
  Rejected as heavier than warranted: more methodology surface to learn and maintain than a pre-code
  project of this size needs, for capability it will not use soon.
- **OpenFastTrace** — a mature trace tool, but JVM-based. Rejected: it drags a Java toolchain into a
  Go + Svelte repo whose minimal, native-toolchain-free dependency footprint
  ([`FOUNDATIONS.md`](../FOUNDATIONS.md) §2) actively resists exactly that. Doorstop's Python is a
  lighter, more idiomatic addition.
- **A homegrown Markdown register + validator script** — a table of IDs plus a `check-reqs.mjs` in
  the existing `scripts/` style. Rejected: it would work, but it teaches no established methodology
  (a stated goal), and it reinvents suspect-link fingerprinting and traceability that Doorstop
  already does correctly. The learning value is in using a real tool's model, not rebuilding a worse
  one.

## Consequences

- **Traceability is now a hard gate, not a convention.** A requirement with no verification item, an
  orphaned item, or a dangling reference fails CI. Editing a parent flags its children suspect until
  re-reviewed, so a requirement change cannot silently leave stale downstream items.
- **Doorstop proves linkage; it does not prove correctness.** A `TST` item's `references` resolving
  to a file only proves the link is real — that the check *passes* is proven by `just verify` and the
  test suite. This division is deliberate and is the mental model to hold: Doorstop = the graph is
  complete and current; the runner = the checks in the graph actually pass.
- **Python enters the dev toolchain.** A venv and a `pip` Dependabot ecosystem are added. This is
  contained to dev tooling; the shipped artifact (a Go static binary) is untouched.
- **Doorstop cannot reference files under dot-directories.** Its reference finder skips any path with
  a dot-prefixed component, so a `type: file` reference to `.github/workflows/checks.yml` (or anything
  under `.github/`, `.venv/`, etc.) does not resolve. Where a requirement is verified by CI wiring
  that lives only under `.github/`, the resolvable artifact (e.g. `scripts/check-links.mjs`) is the
  machine-checked `references` entry and the CI wiring is cited in the item's prose. `TST011`
  documents this pattern.
- **Reviewing is a manual discipline.** `doorstop review` re-blesses a child after its parent moved;
  blindly scripting it away would defeat the re-validation the tool exists to provide.
