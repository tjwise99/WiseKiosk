"""The docs/decisions/ directory and its index table agree: every ADR file has a
row, every row resolves to a real file, and numbering is contiguous from 0001
with no duplicates. See docs/CI.md § Documentation integrity.

No dependencies: Python stdlib only, plain text scanning — matches
scripts/check-links.mjs's idiom.
