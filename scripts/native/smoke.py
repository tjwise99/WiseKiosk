"""The application comes up and serves natively on the architecture it was built for.

SRS019<!-- The backend runs on every supported architecture --> is settled for the architecture
no published image carries, over a binary and the bundle it is pointed at.

- The ELF header's machine field and the recorded `GOARM` are read against what the caller asked
  for, before anything is started.
- A held address is refused before anything is probed.
- The binary is started with the bundle as its static root and asked for liveness to a bound.
- The page's own path is fetched.
- The binary's own `-health-check` flag is run as a second process against the serving one.

The ARMv6 half is what the toolchain recorded about the build, not a property of the instructions
emitted. Reading it needs `go` on PATH, whose absence fails this rather than skipping the assertion.

Why each is asserted and what the emulation does not settle is docs/CI.md § Native binary run;
what this has been run against is ../cases/smoke-native.md.

Usage: smoke.py <binary> <static-root> <goarch>[/<goarm>]
