"""Every tracked file's extension is in a declared set.

[ADR 0017 rev 8](../docs/decisions/0017-authored-language-set.md) binds two authored languages to
their audience — Go, TypeScript, the Svelte component format and CSS for what ships, Python (standard
library only) for what checks the repository — and rules that everything else in the tree is
*derived*: a toolchain's own required input format, not a language anyone authors in. Documentation,
and the assets a build serves, are carved out of the decision entirely — CSS excepted, which also
carries a documentation disposition beside its authored one, both named where the extension is
declared below.

This asserts that every extension actually present is one of those three kinds, declared and
attributed below — never inferred from what happens to already be in the tree. A file type nobody has
decided about **fails**, which is the opposite of a denylist: the unbounded set ADR 0017 rev 8 rejected
would pass silently on a new extension, and only a bounded, declared set can fail on one.

`sh` and `mjs` are **not** declared extensions: ADR 0017 rev 8 names POSIX sh and Node as authoring
nothing at all, so an allowlisted `.sh`/`.mjs` extension would be the one hole that lets past exactly
the violation this check exists to catch. The check scripts already written in them are real, but each
carries **a disposition rather than an exemption** — ADR 0017 rev 8's own words for this, applied here
the same way it applies there — so each is declared individually, by its exact repository-relative
path, in `LEGACY`, citing the record that ends it. A *new* `.sh` or `.mjs` file, anywhere not in that
list, fails — and an entry whose file is no longer tracked fails too, so the list cannot silently
outlive the conversion it was grandfathering.

A file with no extension is judged the same way, by its exact repository-relative path in
`NO_EXTENSION` — `justfile`, `LICENSE` and `.gitignore` serve nothing in common, and a shared
no-extension bucket would wave through the next one just as silently as an unbounded extension set
would.

Population is `git ls-files`. An empty population fails rather than passing: a run that resolved no
tracked file judged nothing, and this repository's whole review checklist turns on that not reading
as a clean tree.
