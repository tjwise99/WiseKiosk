"""The documented bring-up procedure reaches a serving deployment from a published release.

docs/DEPLOYMENT.md § Bring-up: the procedure is three commands, run in the directory holding the
release's two assets. This runs the first `sh` fence after the doc's `## Bring-up` heading,
unedited, in a fixed working directory (`bring-up/` at the repository root) holding the two assets
`gh release download` fetches for the given release tag.

Before the block runs, `ghcr.io/tjwise99/wisekiosk:latest` is asserted to resolve to the given
digest — the one assertion in the tree that `latest` moved to the release this run was handed, and
the poll that waits out registry propagation.

Serving is two assertions, both required (docs/CI.md § Deployment and bring-up): the compose
service's container reaches Docker health status `healthy` within a deadline derived from the
image's own declared healthcheck (interval, retries and start period substituted with Docker's
defaults where the image declares none), and `GET /config.json` returns the downloaded
`config.example.json` byte for byte — the assertion health status alone cannot make, since
`/healthz` is configuration-blind by design.

Usage: bring_up.py [--doc PATH] <tag> <digest>
