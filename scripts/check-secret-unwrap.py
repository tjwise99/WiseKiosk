"""Exactly one non-test reference to the secret type's unwrap method exists in the backend.

ADR 0023 rev 1 confines a secret to a type that cannot be emitted, and rests the structural half of
that on one property a reader cannot check by reading a diff: the sole call site that unwraps it to
the raw value is guarded by a lint. This is that lint. What it asserts is docs/CI.md § Module and
framework structure.

The population is the tracked, non-`_test.go` Go files under `backend/`. Test files are exempt by
decision, not by oversight: `secret_test.go` is what proves the redaction paths, and it cannot do that
without unwrapping. Tracked rather than on-disk, so an untracked file is invisible here and
`check-untracked.py` is what fails on one — the pairing docs/CI.md § Repository shape records.

The match reaches a method *value* (`f := s.Reveal`) as well as a call, so an unwrap aliased behind a
variable is counted rather than escaping the count, and it runs over the whole file rather than line
by line, so the selector split across a line break Go accepts is one reference rather than none. It is
textual: a mention inside a comment or a string literal counts too, which fails rather than passes.

**An empty population fails, and so does a tree declaring no `Reveal` at all.** Both would otherwise
report zero references and read exactly like a clean tree — a check keyed on a name finds nothing once
that name is gone, which is the fail-open this whole file exists to avoid.

What this has been run against, in both directions: cases/check-secret-unwrap.md
