"""Every tracked Markdown file outside a top-level dot-directory is claimed by a row in
docs/README.md's index; one rendered path carries one row; a row names a tracked
document, or a directory holding one; every row's link resolves to a tracked file;
and no Guarantees or Excludes cell is empty. A row rendering with a trailing slash
claims the subtree beneath it. See docs/CI.md § Documentation integrity and ADR 0014 rev 2.

No dependencies: Python stdlib only, plain text scanning — matches
