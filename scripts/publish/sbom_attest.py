"""Generate and attest one SPDX SBOM per platform child of the pushed release image.

Reads the pushed index's platform children rather than a hardcoded pair, so a change to the
build's platform matrix needs no change here. Per child: the pinned syft scans the image at that
child's own digest and platform into an SPDX-JSON file, then `cosign attest` binds that file to the
child as an SPDX attestation (docs/CI.md § Publishing and provenance). The index itself is signed by
a separate `cosign sign --recursive` workflow step, which needs no per-child loop.

This is authored Python rather than a `run:` block with a loop, per ADR 0017 rev 9: a workflow
`run:` block carrying control flow is authored sh, and sh authors nothing here.

Inputs, read from the environment (matching this workflow's existing style for passing run-time
values into an invoked script):
  REF    the image reference, without a digest (e.g. ghcr.io/tjwise99/wisekiosk)
  DIGEST the pushed index digest, sha256:<hex>
  SYFT   the path to the pinned syft binary, `download-syft`'s `cmd` output

`cosign` is invoked by bare name, on the PATH `cosign-installer` provides.

What this has been run against, in both directions: cases/publish-verify.md
