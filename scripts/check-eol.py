"""Every file git treats as text is LF-only, over the whole tracked tree.

`.gitattributes` decides which files git treats as text. Runs as the `check-eol` local hook in
`.pre-commit-config.yaml`, beside `mixed-line-ending` — which judges only the files pre-commit hands
it and counts one uniform ending kind as unmixed, so a committed-but-unstaged CRLF file and a
uniformly-CRLF file both pass it. This is authored for that remainder: the tracked tree, any CRLF
(ADR 0016 rev 6).

The population is the tracked set, so an untracked, non-ignored file is invisible to the search and
is reported as unsearchable rather than silently unsearched — visibility fails it, not content. The
pairing with `check-untracked.py` is defence-in-depth, per docs/CI.md § Repository shape. Both
findings accumulate in one run rather than short-circuiting, so an untracked file beside a CRLF
defect is one visit, not two.

`git grep -lI` skips binary content; `-P` gives `\r` its perl-regex meaning. Exit 0 is a match —
this check's failure case — and 1 is none, which over an empty tracked tree reports success
(ADR 0016 rev 6 owner ruling). Any other status is the search itself failing, and is propagated.

What this has been run against, in both directions: cases/check-eol-py.md
