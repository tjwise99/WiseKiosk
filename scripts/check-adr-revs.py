"""Every citation of an ADR pins that ADR's current rev.

An ADR is a versioned document (`docs/decisions/README.md`): merged text is revisable, and a
correction is a new rev. A citation names the rev it was written against, so revving an ADR reaches
every document citing it — each is then updated or re-decided rather than left asserting a claim the
ADR's current rev does not make.

Assertions. The ADR set is read from `docs/decisions/` itself, so an uncommitted file is judged; the
citation scan reads the tracked set, and fails on any untracked, non-ignored path it therefore
cannot scan:

- Each ADR's head carries `**Rev:** N`, and the index table in `docs/decisions/README.md` agrees
  with it. The head is authoritative; the table is checked against it, never trusted.
- Each ADR's title line carries the number its filename carries. Identity by number is the premise
  every citation here rests on, and the head is where the document states it — the same head, one
  field over from the rev. Only the number is compared: the separator and the title text are the
  author's, and a rule reaching them would be a formatting gate.
- Every entry in `docs/decisions/` is an ADR this judges or a reported problem. One misnamed by case,
  separator or digit count carries no readable number, and passing over it reports a population
  smaller than the directory. The directory read above is what lets this see an entry no commit has
  yet introduced.
- Each ADR's *Revisions* section carries one changelog line per rev, numbered 1 to that head rev.
- No two files carry one number. Uniqueness is `scripts/check-adr-index.mjs`'s to enforce; it is
  reported here because a number two documents carry has no one rev to hold a citation of it to.
- Every `ADR NNNN` in prose is followed by `rev M`, and M is that ADR's current rev.
- Every markdown link resolving to an ADR file is titled `ADR NNNN rev M` likewise. The link rule is
  what the prose rule cannot reach: a citation spelled `[NNNN](NNNN-slug.md)` names no ADR in prose
  at all.
- A citation spelled in any other way — a plural, a hyphen, the wrong case, a reference-style link, a
  raw `<a href>` — is reported as malformed rather than passed over. The set this recognises is the
  set it can hold to a rev, so anything outside it must fail rather than shrink the population.

That an ADR's rev was raised for a good reason, and that a citation pinning the current rev still
means what the ADR says, is decided by nothing here.

Whether every index row has a file, and numbering is contiguous, is `scripts/check-adr-index.mjs`.
An ADR carrying no row is reported here as well, because the table assertion above is then the thing
with nothing to compare. It is not that such an ADR goes unjudged: the rev is read from the head, so
the title, changelog, collision and citation rules all still hold it, and deleting the table check
would change no citation verdict.
