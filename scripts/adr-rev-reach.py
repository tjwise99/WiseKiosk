"""The citations a rev bump re-pinned without touching the sentence they hang off.

`scripts/check-adr-revs.py` holds every citation to its ADR's current rev, and says in its own
docstring that whether a citation pinning the current rev still means what the ADR says is decided by
nothing there. A sweep that rewrites `rev N` to `rev N+1` across the tree satisfies that gate while
re-deciding nothing, and the green result then certifies a reach that did not happen.

This enumerates the work that sweep leaves. It decides nothing about a claim and fails on no diff:
what it produces is a list of file, line and sentence for a reader to judge, under
`CONTRIBUTING.md` review checklist question 21, *Rev reach*.

Reported. For each ADR whose head rev moved between the base ref and the head tree, and whose body
outside its head-rev line and its *Revisions* section also changed: every line in the tracked set
that is identical across the two trees once every `rev N` token is masked, and different before
masking. That is a line whose sole edit was the pin.

Not reported, each deliberately:

- A citing line the change also edited. The author had the sentence open; a sweep did not write it.
  Alignment comes from a difflib `equal` block over the masked lines, so an edited line falls out of
  the pairing rather than being tested and passed.
- Every citation of an ADR whose body did not move — a rev that only records its own text, or one
  whose only edit was re-pinning the ADRs it cites. Masking is applied to the body comparison for
  that second case, so a sweep does not cascade into the records it passes through.
- A citation whose pin did not move, which `check-adr-revs` fails on independently, and one added by
  the change, which is not a re-pin.
- A changelog line and its continuations in `docs/decisions/`, which pin a rev deliberately.

Not decidable here, and the reason this reports rather than fails: whether the claim survived. A rev
that does not touch what a citation asserts is legal and ordinary — most of a sweep is that — so a
gate failing every pin-only edit would fail closed on legal input, and the exemption list it would
grow is where a bypass gets spelled ([ADR 0011 rev 1](../docs/decisions/0011-requirement-or-convention.md)
routes a judgement obligation to the review checklist instead).
