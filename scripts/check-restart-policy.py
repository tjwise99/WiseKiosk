"""Every service in the committed deployment recipe declares restart policy `unless-stopped`.

The value is the assertion rather than the key's presence: `unless-stopped` and not `always`,
because the latter also overrides a deliberate manual stop (docs/DEPLOYMENT.md § The deployment
recipe, ADR 0020 rev 2).

That one key and no other. Every other value in the recipe is a sample default an operator is
expected to weigh and change, so gating one would assert a recommendation as an obligation —
docs/CI.md § Deployment and bring-up, which is also why this is not a recipe linter.

No dependencies: Python stdlib only, plain text scanning (no YAML parser), matching
scripts/check-repo-silo.py's idiom.

What this has been run against, in both directions: cases/check-restart-policy-py.md
