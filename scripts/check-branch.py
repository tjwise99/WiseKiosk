"""The branch name must follow type_number-snake_name (ADR 0006 rev 3): the shape is
defined once in scripts/branch-shape.regex, shared with the branch-shape pre-push hook;
the number resolves via the GitHub API to an open issue carrying a milestone
and exactly one type label, which is the branch type (ADR 0013 rev 3). main and
dependabot/* are exempt. When an open PR exists, its Development field
(closingIssuesReferences) must link the branch's issue — any base; body
keywords only write the record against the default branch, so other bases
need the manual link. The PR's base and the issue's parent must agree: a
sub-issue means a shared merge target. Owner/repo come from the origin
remote, so the check works on any clone. GITHUB_TOKEN or GH_TOKEN is used as
a bearer token when set (rate limits, CI); the GraphQL phase requires it.

Dependencies: git. Standard library only (urllib, json).
