"""Gate one dependency ecosystem's known vulnerabilities against the exception register.

What this asserts is docs/CI.md § *Dependency vulnerabilities* and § *The exception register*.
Standard library only, like every other plain-python check in the tree.

`--scope go` runs `go -C <go-dir> tool govulncheck -json ./...`: a finding whose trace reaches a
symbol fails, and a finding reported only at package or module level (the vulnerable code is present
but never called) prints as informational — the one reachability allowance CI.md's Go paragraph
states. `--scope npm` runs `npm --prefix <npm-dir> audit --json` over the whole tree, no
`--audit-level`: every advisory fails, at any severity.

Pass/fail is decided from the parsed JSON alone; neither scanner's own exit status is read; `-json`
mode is documented to exit 0 whatever govulncheck finds, and this script holds both scopes to the one
rule rather than trusting npm's exit code to mean something the other scope's tool cannot promise.

The register (`--register`, default `.vulnerability-exceptions.json` at the repository root) is a
JSON list; each entry names exactly five fields — `advisory`, `scope`, `no_fix_because`,
`no_alternative_because`, `review_by` — documented in docs/CI.md § *The exception register*. An
entry's `advisory` matches a finding by that finding's primary id or any alias (a GO- id's GHSA/CVE
aliases; an npm advisory's GHSA id, read from its `via[]` entry's advisory URL). Only entries whose
own `scope` equals the scope being checked are examined by a given run — the other scope's entries are
that scope's own run to validate — so a full validation of the whole register needs both `--scope`
values run. An entry whose `scope` is missing or is neither `go` nor `npm` cannot be routed to either
run, so it fails both rather than falling through unexamined. Within its scope: every entry must be
well-formed and current (today <= review_by <=
today+90 days, UTC); an entry matching nothing this run's scanner reported is an orphan; an entry
matching a finding in the scanned project's own package (a Go package path under this module, or the
npm project's own package name) is refused regardless of currency, because first-party code has no
exception path; likewise a Go standard-library finding, which the register never covers at all
(owner ruling, ticket #264) — the remedy is always the Go toolchain bump. The complete finding list
is always printed, suppressed findings included.

Usage: check_vulns.py --scope go|npm [--go-dir DIR] [--npm-dir DIR] [--register FILE]

What this has been run against, in both directions: ../cases/check-vulns-go.md and
../cases/check-vulns-npm.md
