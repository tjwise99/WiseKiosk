# The `verify` job's release checks (`scripts/publish/sbom_attest.py`, `verify_metadata.py`, `verify_release.py`)

The inputs these checks have been run against, in both directions. What they *assert*, and why, is
[`docs/CI.md`](../../docs/CI.md)'s § *Publishing and provenance*; how to run a case is
[`../README.md`](../README.md)'s. `scripts/publish/verify_permissions.py` (the no-write-scope gate)
has its own file, [`check-publish-permissions.md`](check-publish-permissions.md).

**Tools, pinned as run:** cosign v3.1.3 and syft v1.51.1, each named as a `with:` literal in both
the `publish` and `verify` jobs — Renovate's regex manager bumps every match of `cosign-release:`
and `syft-version:` in `publish.yml` in one PR, which is what keeps the two per-tool pins equal; a
hand edit drifting them apart surfaces as a package-set mismatch in `verify`'s SBOM regeneration
comparison rather than failing silently. That the dependency dashboard actually lists both matches
per tool is a WI4 read-back, not yet confirmed. `check-jsonschema==0.38.0`
(`pipx run`, pinned in `scripts/publish/verify_release.py` rather than in the workflow, since that is
where the invocation lives); `gh` and `docker buildx imagetools inspect` at whatever version the
runner or this host provides — neither is pinned, matching this repository's existing convention for
those two tools elsewhere.

## What is verified here, against measured and synthetic data

**Two releases already exist** — `v0.1.0` and `v0.0.1` (pre-release), both cut before this PR's
`verify` job reached `main`, and both anonymously readable at
`ghcr.io/tjwise99/wisekiosk@sha256:27ff2637…` — but **neither carries this job's signature or
attestation**, since `release`-triggered workflows resolve from the default branch rather than the
tag's ref, so `verify` could not have run against them. What is genuinely unobserved is not "any
release", but a release this job actually signed and attested; that is `v0.0.1 --prerelease`'s next
cut, scheduled for after this PR merges (§ *Sequencing*, WI4). The real, unattested releases already
let far more of this file be measured directly than an unattested-anywhere premise would — see the
attached-set and metadata rows below, both run against `v0.1.0` for real — which is also how the B1
defect this file once carried (a wrong provenance-negative message, stated as observed when it was
not) was found and fixed.

Everything below that could not be run against a real published digest was exercised against real
tool output measured for this ticket (a throwaway image built from this repository's own
`Dockerfile`, pushed to a local `registry:2` container, scanned with the pinned syft and inspected
with `docker buildx imagetools inspect`, measured during implementation and not separately retained)
and against realistic synthetic fixtures built from that measured shape. The **reviewer-runnable
seeds** section below is what a reviewer (or WI4's exercise) runs against a real signed digest once
one exists.

**`sbom_attest.py` (publish job, per-child SBOM generation and attestation).** `read_children`
(`scripts/publish/common.py`) parsed a real two-entry `docker buildx imagetools inspect --format
'{{json .Manifest}}'` output (one real platform child plus a docker-generated attestation-manifest
descriptor at `platform: {"architecture":"unknown","os":"unknown"}`, produced when a test build did
not disable provenance/sbom) into `[{"digest": ..., "platform": "linux/amd64"}]` pairs — verified
against a mocked two-child fixture directly (`{'digest': 'sha256:aaa', 'platform': 'linux/amd64'},
{'digest': 'sha256:bbb', 'platform': 'linux/arm64'}`), matching the two-platform shape production
always builds (`platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64`) with `provenance: false, sbom: false`, which
never produces the spurious third entry.

**`verify_metadata.py` (annotations and labels) — exercised against the real, published two-platform
`v0.1.0` index**, `sha256:27ff2637…`, commit `4ee8b022…`:

| Direction | Case | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Must pass | The real image, `DOCKER_METADATA_ANNOTATIONS_LEVELS: index,manifest` (this repository's committed declaration), matching commit | `2 annotation level(s), 3 surface(s), 2 child config(s): the nine keys are present and bound to 4ee8b022…` |
| Must fail | The same real image, wrong `COMMIT` | seven named problems, including `no annotation surface was successfully checked` |
| Must fail | The same real image, `DOCKER_METADATA_ANNOTATIONS_LEVELS: index,bogus-level` | `unrecognised annotation level 'bogus-level'`, and `index` is still checked |
| Must fail | Two of nine keys set, seven missing, on `index`, `manifest` and `manifest-descriptor` levels (synthetic, single-platform pushed image) | lists the seven missing keys per surface, by name |
| Must fail | A single-platform index but `check_labels`'s branch expects more than one child (synthetic) | `.Image is a single config but the index has N platform child(ren)` — the degenerate single-platform `.Image` shape (no platform-keyed map) is asserted rather than silently mismatched |

**The genuinely multi-platform case is closed, not a gap.** The real `v0.1.0` index's
`imagetools inspect --format '{{json .Image}}'` returns a genuinely platform-keyed map (a top-level
`linux/amd64` key, each with its own `config`), confirmed by two independent routes:
`review-269-docs` ran `imagetools inspect` directly against the digest; `review-269-content` ran
`verify_metadata.py` end to end against the same digest and got the `2 child config(s)` result in the
must-pass row above. `check_labels`'s platform-keyed branch is exercised against real data, not only
against the documented `buildx` behaviour it was originally written to.

**`verify_release.py`'s pure logic — unit-tested directly**, since the surrounding `cosign`/`gh`
calls other than provenance's (below) need a real signed digest this PR cannot yet produce:

| Function | Case | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `check_sbom_content` | A clean predicate: Go module present, one `distro=alpine-3.24.1` qualifier, describing package `versionInfo` matches the child digest, purl `arch=amd64` matches the platform | no problems |
| `check_sbom_content` | No package carries a `distro=` qualifier at all | `no package carries a purl 'distro=' qualifier` |
| `check_sbom_content` | Cross-wired binding: describing package's `versionInfo` is the *other* child's digest, everything else (Go module, distro) correct | fails only `describing package versionInfo '...' does not equal the child digest '...'` — the Go-module and distro assertions do not also fire, proving the binding fails by name rather than by accident (criterion 11) |
| `check_sbom_content` | Wrong distro name (`debian` against a Dockerfile whose final `FROM` is `alpine`) | `distro name 'debian' does not match the Dockerfile's final FROM image 'alpine'` |
| pair-set comparison (inline, `attested_pairs != regenerated_pairs`) | One package's `versionInfo` altered between the attested and regenerated sets (version drift) | set inequality detected, with the differing pair named on each side |
| `step_sbom`'s envelope-count guard | `cosign verify-attestation` prints two envelope lines (a re-run's second attestation, simulated) | `expected exactly one spdxjson attestation, cosign verify-attestation printed 2` — fails before extraction is attempted |
| `extract_predicate` | A synthetic DSSE envelope (`{"payload": base64(json)}`) matching `cosign verify-attestation`'s documented single-line output shape | round-trips to the original predicate exactly |
| `check_provenance_fields` | A realistic `--format json` entry matching the plan's measured shape (`buildSignerURI`, `sourceRepositoryURI`, `sourceRepositoryDigest`, `statement.subject[0].digest.sha256`, `predicateType`) | no problems |
| `check_provenance_fields` | Wrong `sourceRepositoryDigest` | fails only the `sourceRepositoryDigest` assertion |
| `check_provenance_fields` | Wrong `subject[0].digest.sha256` | fails only the subject-digest assertion |
| `check_provenance_fields` | `statement.subject: []` (an empty list, not a missing key) | fails the subject-digest assertion on `None`, rather than raising `IndexError` — the `[{}]` default only covers a *missing* key, so this is asserted separately |
| `check_provenance_fields` | Two entries instead of one | `expected exactly one attestation entry, got 2` |
| `step_signature`, `step_attached` | `read_children` returns `[]` without raising (a single-platform export, which `docker buildx build` refuses to annotate at the index level at all — measured, § below) | both fail closed with `no platform child to check`, rather than reporting `0 problem(s)` on zero children verified; `step_signature` still checks the index's own signature and `step_attached` still runs its two `gh release view` reads, since neither depends on children |
| `go_module_name`, `dockerfile_final_from`, `purl_qualifier` | Run against this repository's own `backend/go.mod` and `Dockerfile`, and against two real purls measured with syft v1.51.1 against this repository's own two-platform image: the apk purl `pkg:apk/alpine/alpine-baselayout@3.7.2-r1?arch=x86_64&distro=alpine-3.24.1` (amd64 child) and the image-descriptor purl's `arch=` qualifier, `arch=amd64` (amd64 child) / `arch=arm64` (arm64 child) | `github.com/tjwise99/WiseKiosk/backend`; `('alpine', '3.24')`; `alpine-3.24.1` / `x86_64` from the apk purl — **a different vocabulary from the image-descriptor purl's own `amd64`/`arm64`**, which is what `check_sbom_content`'s binding assertion actually compares against (`child["platform"].split("/", 1)[1]`), never apk's `x86_64`/`aarch64` |

**Two provenance refusal texts are measured against the real `v0.1.0` index**, replacing an
earlier version of this file that asserted an unmeasured, incorrect shared literal (see *Reviewer-
runnable seeds* below for the fix this drove in `verify_release.py`) — `gh` 2.97.0:

| Condition | rc | stdout | stderr |
|---|---|---|---|
| A flipped (reversed-hex) digest against the real index | 1 | 0 bytes | `Error: failed to fetch remote image: GET https://ghcr.io/v2/tjwise99/wisekiosk/manifests/sha256:<flipped>: MANIFEST_UNKNOWN: manifest unknown` |
| The real digest, no attestation attached (true of both existing releases) | 1 | 0 bytes | `Error: HTTP 404: Not Found (https://api.github.com/repos/tjwise99/WiseKiosk/attestations/sha256:<digest>?...)` |
| A wrong `--signer-workflow` against a digest that *does* carry an attestation | — | — | unobserved: no such digest exists anywhere reachable to produce it; recorded as observed in WI4 rather than guessed at |

**The vendored SPDX 2.3 schema** (`scripts/publish/spdx-schema-2.3.json`, from
https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/v2.3/schemas/spdx-schema.json at tag `v2.3`) validated a real
syft-generated SBOM (`ok -- validation done`) and rejected the same document with `spdxVersion`
deleted (`'spdxVersion' is a required property`), via `check-jsonschema==0.38.0`.

## Reviewer-runnable seeds, against any real published digest

Once a real release exists (WI4's pre-release exercise, or any later release), each of these can be
run directly and is expected to fail for the reason given. None of these mutate the release; each
either targets a deliberately wrong identity/digest/workflow, or a throwaway copy pushed under a
mismatched digest.

- **Signature, wrong identity.** `cosign verify --certificate-identity-regexp
  '^https://example\.invalid/' --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
  <ref>@<digest>` — exits non-zero, printing `none of the expected identities matched`.
- **Provenance, flipped digest.** `gh attestation verify oci://<ref>@sha256:<the real hex, reversed>
  --repo tjwise99/WiseKiosk --signer-workflow tjwise99/WiseKiosk/.github/workflows/publish.yml` —
  exits non-zero, printing the substring `MANIFEST_UNKNOWN: manifest unknown` on stderr, with an
  empty stdout — the registry refuses to resolve the reference before any attestation lookup runs.
  Measured against the real `v0.1.0` index; the digest is interpolated into the message, so only
  this substring is stable across releases, never the full line.
- **Provenance, wrong signer workflow.** `gh attestation verify oci://<ref>@<digest> --repo
  tjwise99/WiseKiosk --signer-workflow tjwise99/WiseKiosk/.github/workflows/checks.yml` — exits
  non-zero with an empty stdout. Deliberately weak: with no attested digest to test against, what
  this prints when a *real* attestation exists but the signer workflow is wrong is unobserved before
  a signed release exists, and could print the same `HTTP 404` text a plain no-attestation digest
  does — the six positive `--format json` field assertions carry the verdict for this check, not
  this negative's text. Marked observed in WI4, once a signed digest exists to test the genuine
  mismatch case against.
- **Provenance, registry-copy `--bundle-from-oci`, absent or wrong digest.** Push a throwaway copy of
  the image under a mismatched digest (or strip the bundle), never the real release, and run `gh
  attestation verify oci://<that ref>@<that digest> --repo tjwise99/WiseKiosk --signer-workflow
  tjwise99/WiseKiosk/.github/workflows/publish.yml --bundle-from-oci` — must fail.
- **SBOM, a second attestation on re-run.** `cosign attest` a second SPDX predicate onto the same
  child (simulating a re-run of `publish`) — `step_sbom`'s envelope-count guard must fail before
  extraction, rather than validating whichever envelope `cosign verify-attestation` prints first.
- **SBOM, version-drift predicate.** Take a real attested SPDX predicate, alter one package's
  `versionInfo`, feed it in place of the regenerated document — must fail the `(name, versionInfo)`
  pair comparison (not the binding assertion).
- **SBOM, cross-wired predicate.** Feed one child's real SBOM predicate in place of the other's — the
  two children's pair sets differ only in the describing package's own `(name, versionInfo)` entry, so
  this must fail the binding assertion specifically, not the pair comparison.
- **`verify_permissions.py` fail-closed guards**, against throwaway `publish.yml` copies (not the
  committed one): `packages: write` added under `verify`; the `verify` job renamed. Both covered fully
  in [`check-publish-permissions.md`](check-publish-permissions.md).
- **`verify_metadata.py`'s unknown-level guard**, against a throwaway `publish.yml` copy declaring
  `DOCKER_METADATA_ANNOTATIONS_LEVELS: index,bogus-level` — already exercised above against a real
  pushed image; reproducible against any digest.

**A defect this case-writing process found and fixed, rather than only recorded.** An earlier version
of the flipped-digest and wrong-signer-workflow seeds both asserted a single shared literal, `Error:
verifying with issuer "sigstore.dev"`, taken from the plan rather than measured. Reproduced against
the real `v0.1.0` index, neither refusal prints that text — a flipped digest fails registry
resolution with `MANIFEST_UNKNOWN` before any attestation lookup, and the plain no-attestation case
gives an HTTP 404 from GitHub's API — so `--step provenance` would have failed on every correct
release, including the first `--prerelease` cut after this PR merges, for a defect in the checker
rather than in the release. Fixed in `verify_release.py` by asserting the two texts actually measured
above and leaving the wrong-signer-workflow case unasserted on text until one can be observed.

**Fallibility is recorded once here, against throwaway copies; no standing meta-gate re-tests it**
([`docs/CI.md`](../../docs/CI.md) § *Generated boundary contract* states that convention).

## Known gaps, per the owner

Each needs a deliberately broken release and is unseeded, by the owner's own ruling that seeding a
broken release was skipped for #269 publish verification: a missing release asset; a missing
attestation (no SBOM, no signature, or no provenance attached to a child); a dropped annotation key;
an empty annotation or label value; a wrong `.revision` on one surface only (the others correct).

## Fail-direction in CI

Not yet exercised against a release this job actually signed and attested — the first such release
is the first run. Back-filled with run IDs, `cosign tree`'s observed child headings, `gh`'s observed
positive JSON, and the wrong-signer-workflow refusal text, by the docs-only follow-up PR after the
pre-release exercise (§ *Sequencing*, WI4), not by a commit inside this PR.
