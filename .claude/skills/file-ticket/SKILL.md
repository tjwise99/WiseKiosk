  File a WiseKiosk issue that conforms to the gates, from a session where the GitHub template picker
  does not exist. Carries the template-to-label-to-branch-type mapping, the required milestone, how
  ordering and epic membership are recorded, and the API traps that make each of those silently
  fail. Invoke before `gh issue create` — filing a ticket by hand produces one that cannot be
  branched on.

# File a ticket

`gh issue create --title … --body …` **bypasses the template picker entirely.** All four files in
[`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](../../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) apply to none of it: no type label, no
headings, no milestone. That is the root cause this skill exists for, and it is not hypothetical —
ten of sixteen open tickets were unbranchable on 2026-07-24, and the identical defect recurred four
days later.

**This skill is advisory.** Nothing forces its use, and a session that does not invoke it is not
stopped by it. The half with teeth is `scripts/check-branch.py`, which refuses the merge later —
so a ticket filed wrong is not lost, only expensive. What follows is how to not pay that.

## What the gate will demand

From [`docs/CI.md` § *Repository shape*](../../../docs/CI.md#repository-shape) and
[ADR 0013 rev 3](../../../docs/decisions/0013-work-tracking-invariants.md), decided against the ticket
whose branch is being cut:

- **open** — it cannot be closed when the branch is worked;
- **exactly one type label** from `task`, `bug`, `design`, `module` — a second makes the branch type
  ambiguous. Non-type labels (`documentation`) are free;
- **a milestone**;
- **a parent iff the work targets an integration branch** — see *Epic membership* below.

## Type, template and branch are one choice

Picking the type picks the template and the branch prefix. They cannot diverge; a branch's type names
the template its ticket was opened from ([ADR 0006 rev 3](../../../docs/decisions/0006-process-gates.md)).

| Type | Template | Branch |
|---|---|---|
| `task` | [`task.md`](../../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md) | `task_<n>-…` |
| `bug` | [`bug_report.md`](../../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) | `bug_<n>-…` |
| `design` | [`design_decision.md`](../../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/design_decision.md) | `design_<n>-…` |
| `module` | [`new_module.md`](../../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new_module.md) | `module_<n>-…` |

**The labels are not listed here.** Read them out of the chosen template's own `labels:` frontmatter
and pass exactly those — a design decision carries `documentation` alongside `design`, and a copy of
that set in this file would be one more thing to keep in sync:

```sh
sed -n '/^labels:/s/^labels:[[:space:]]*//p' .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/design_decision.md
```

## Filing

Body from the template file, YAML frontmatter stripped, then filled in. Say in the body that it was
filed this way, as the templates' own tickets do: *"Filed via `gh`, which bypasses the template
picker; body follows `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/<file>`."*

```sh
sed '1{/^---$/!q}; 1,/^---$/d' .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md > /tmp/body.md   # then edit
gh issue create --title "…" --body-file /tmp/body.md --label task --milestone "1 · Requirements complete"
```

**`--milestone` takes the title, not the number.** `--milestone 1` fails with `'1' not found`; the
titles carry a `·` (`1 · Requirements complete`), so quote them exactly. `gh milestone list` does not
exist — read the titles with
`gh api repos/tjwise99/WiseKiosk/milestones --jq '.[]|"\(.number) \(.title)"'`. `gh issue create`
resolves the milestone before creating the issue, so that mistake costs nothing.

**A template's declared label is dropped when the repository has no such label**, without complaint —
that is how `new_module.md` produced unlabeled, unbranchable tickets from the picker for as long as
`module` was missing. Whether `--label` behaves the same way or refuses like `--milestone` has not
been tested here, so read the labels back after filing rather than trusting the exit code either way:
`gh issue view <n> --json labels`.

## Ordering, and epic membership

**Ordering goes in GitHub's native dependency edges, never in the body.** No `⛔ Blocked by:` line:
it mirrors the edges and drifts from them — four of eight such lines had already gone stale when they
were stripped. Ready-to-work is the derived `-is:blocked` view.

**A sub-issue means a shared merge target, not a topic.** Make the new ticket a sub-issue **iff** its
pull request will target an integration branch rather than `main`; the parent is the ticket anchoring
that branch. Everything else that merely relates is grouped by the milestone. The gate asserts this
in both directions, so a sub-issue whose PR targets `main` fails just as a PR into an integration
branch from a non-member does.

The sub-issues endpoint takes the parent's **issue number** in the path but the child's **database
`id`** in the body — not its number. And it takes it as an **integer**: `-f` sends a string and the
edge is not created, so use `-F`. Both mistakes leave the parent's sub-issue list untouched while the
command looks like it did something, which is why the edge is read back below rather than assumed.

```sh
child=$(gh api repos/tjwise99/WiseKiosk/issues/<child-number> --jq .id)
gh api repos/tjwise99/WiseKiosk/issues/<parent-number>/sub_issues -F sub_issue_id=$child
gh api repos/tjwise99/WiseKiosk/issues/<parent-number>/sub_issues --jq '[.[].number]'   # confirm
```

Detaching is the same shape against the singular path: `gh api -X DELETE
repos/tjwise99/WiseKiosk/issues/<parent-number>/sub_issue -F sub_issue_id=$child`.

## In the body

- **Never a bare `#N`, and never a number as a name.** Issues and PRs share one counter, so `#66` and
  `#69` are indistinguishable by shape. Write `PR #66` for a pull request and `#69 tree rebuild` —
  number *and* name — for a ticket. The same holds for requirement identifiers: `SRS026
  backend-unreachable state`, never bare, because a renumber rewrites `links:` and leaves prose
  pointing at whatever now occupies the number.
- **Every relative link must resolve inside the repository** — issue bodies are outside the link
  gate's population (it reads tracked Markdown), so a `../blob/main/…` link is on you.
- State what authorizes the work and what is already decided, so the ticket does not re-litigate
  settled ground when it is finally worked.
